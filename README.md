- Leap year checker
- Positive / Negative / Zero checker
- Vowel or consonant checker
- Grade calculation

### Loops
Programs focused on iteration and logic:
- Factorial of a number
- Fibonacci series
- Prime number check
- Sum of natural numbers
- Multiplication table
- Rotate a list by N positions
- Word filtering using conditions

### Strings
Programs involving string manipulation:
- Remove vowels from a string
- Count uppercase and lowercase letters
- Word frequency counter

### Lists
Programs demonstrating list operations:
- Finding common elements
- List rotation
- List traversal and manipulation

### Dictionaries
Programs based on key–value data structures:
- Word frequency counter
- Contact storage and retrieval

### Sets
Programs demonstrating:
- Duplicate removal
- Common element detection
- Set operations

### Functions
Programs using:
- User-defined functions
- Return values

## Mini Projects

Located in the `mini_pro_programs` folder:

- **ATM System** (basic and function-based)
- **Number Guessing Game**
- **Password Validator**
- **Shopping Cart System**
- **Simple Contact Book**
- **Contact Book using Functions**
- **Student Mark Management System**
